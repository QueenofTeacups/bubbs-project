        <h2>"Bubbs in Space" is a children's book about autism awareness and acceptance!</h2>
        <h3>About the book:</h3>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>"Bubbs in Space" showcases the common behaviors that come with autism as well as how to help, support and enjoy life alongside a world filled with neurodiversity. Centered around Orion, a little boy on the autism spectrum, this is a children's book meant to share the way someone like him sees and experiences everything in a different, unique way. In the book, Orion's siblings showcase the different ways you can be supportive and loving towards children on the spectrum. This book takes place in Bubbs' dreams as he travels to different planets to show how he experiences the different parts of his life. His siblings are there to support him and have fun along the way!</p>

        <p>The main theme of this book is to teach children how to fully embrace our differences, how to spread love, and the importance of understanding one another. It can be difficult for young children to understand how someone on the autism spectrum perceives the world around them, but it is author Emily Jean Sanders' goal to spread creative literature that helps expand the popular understanding of neurodiversity. Join in a special journey meant to educate, entertain, and warm the hearts of those who feel misunderstood.</p>
